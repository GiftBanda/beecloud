                You will notice that we donâ€™t provide an hourly billing cost. This is harmful to you in the sense that it discourages efficiency and creativity from our part and in the end, we are both focused on the outcome and not inefficient hours worked.
The prices provided below are fixed, which means there are no hidden fees and we absorb all the risk in completing the project within these boundaries.

The pricing for each package is as follows:
<span>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>
            Standard package is k3,750 once-off
            </strong>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>
            Honey package is k6,750 once-off
            </strong>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>
            Corporate package is k10,750 once-off + k850 /month retainer 
            </strong>
        
        </li>
    </ul>
</span>

Once-off fees are to be paid in full upfront and the retainer amounts are due at the beginning of each month.
We guarantee our work. If at any point, you feel that we have failed in delivering what is described in this proposal, please contact us and we will either make necessary changes or refund you.
